What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts to version control the directory. We need to do this if we need to enable version control on the directory


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Helps group changes we want to commit into groups. Also segregate changes we want to commit from those which we do not want to commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Keep adding all files belonging to the logical change and commit them all at once
